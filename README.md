# LapSum: One Method to Differentiate Them All - ICML 2025

This repository contains the official implementation of **LapSum**, a novel approach for differentiable ranking, sorting, and top-k selection, as presented in our ICML 2025 paper:

**"LapSum - One Method to Differentiate Them All: Ranking, Sorting and Top-k Selection"**  
[arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06242) | [ICML 2025 proceedings](https://proceedings.icml.cc/)

## Installation CPP/CUDA

The core implementation is available as the `lapsum` Python package. For detailed installation instructions, see [./lapsum/README.md](./lapsum/README.md)

**Tested Environment**:  
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Python: 3.10+
- PyTorch: 2.3+
- CUDA: 12.3 (when using GPU acceleration)

## Tutorial Notebooks
For practical examples and educational purposes, see our Jupyter [./tutorial_notebooks/](./tutorial_notebooks/)

**ðŸš€ Pro Tip:**  If you don't want to compile the CPP/CUDA implementation, you can use the **pure PyTorch version** of the library - it's **almost as fast and memory-efficient** as the CUDA implementation! 

For users less experienced with building libraries from source, we especially recommend using the this implementation - it works out-of-the-box with standard PyTorch installations and doesn't require any additional compilation steps!
